The concept:
I like to create "living like" digitals creatures. Creatures that reacts to the incoming data from the infinite world, the human world, our world. Their purpose is to try to communicate with this world by immitating what they see. 
Visualy, it will look like a primitive system of mathematical planctons. Hundreds of little creatures will follow some basic coordinates. For example, if a head appear in the field of the webcam, they will find a fair distribution of the contour and place themselves in a tangeant line of their portion. 
They will also react to the ambiant sound, their shape and color (and behavior?) being influenced by some incoming audio parameters.

I'm really inspired by Zach Lieberman, a creative coder from New York who is also a coach in the SFPC in Manhattan. On his instagram account, he submit almost everyday a new application of creative coding, often playing with computer vision.
